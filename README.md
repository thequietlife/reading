 |  Jan 2026   | Cryptonomicon    | Neal Stephenson   | This was a bit difficult to get into. The first 30 or so pages. But I am glad I persevered - it's amazing. It's a huge book so it is going to take a while. This is the first book by neal stephenson I have read. I also have seveneves and have ordered snow crash.|
 
 |  Dec 2025  | Second Foundation   | Isaac Asimov | ... |
 |    Nov 2025   | Foundation and Empire | Isaac Asimov| ... |
 |    Oct 2025   | Foundation    | Isaac Asimov   | --- |
 |  Dec 2025  | Earth Is Room Enough   | Isaac Asimov | This is the first Isaac Asimov that I have read. It's short stories. I don't love short stories because I usually want the length of a decent size book to get into the characters and story. These are really good. I went on to read another three books by the author (the foundation trilogy) |
