### **cryptonomicon, neal stephenson**
This was a bit difficult to get into. The first 30 or so pages. But I am glad I persevered - it's amazing. This is the first book by neal stephenson I have read. I also have seveneves and have ordered snow crash.

### **isaac asimov, earth is room enough**
This is the first Isaac Asimov that I have read. It's short stories. I don't love short stories because I usually want the length of a decent size book to get into the characters and story. These are really good. I went on to read another three books by the author (the foundation trilogy)
