# 📙 what I am reading for funzies

I guess I'm a 'big' reader. I used to mainly read fiction before going to sleep. But I have been trying to read more during the day rather than scrolling on my phone. I thought it would be cool to keep track of how much fiction I read this year. 


 | Date | Title     | Author |  Notes | Cover |

 |  Jan 2026   | Cryptonomicon    | Neal Stephenson   | I have been meaning to read this for ages. I was warned it was a lot. This was a bit difficult to get into. The first 30 or so pages. But I am glad I persevered - it's amazing. It's a huge book, 900 paages!, so it is going to take a while. This is the first book by neal stephenson I have read. I also have Seveneves and have ordered Snow Crash.| [![book cover](https://github.com/thequietlife/reading/blob/a96c3d69c31be39c1c989cd28e9b82698359a172/images/cryptonomicon.jpeg)](https://github.com/thequietlife/reading/blob/a96c3d69c31be39c1c989cd28e9b82698359a172/images/cryptonomicon.jpeg)  |

  |  Dec 2025  | Second Foundation   | Isaac Asimov | Really good. I had no idea who the Mule was - nice suspense. | [![book cover](https://github.com/thequietlife/reading/blob/f16472a5134aa7c2d3796e680016c9e4a8131d4c/images/Second%20Foundation.jpeg)](https://github.com/thequietlife/reading/blob/f16472a5134aa7c2d3796e680016c9e4a8131d4c/images/Second%20Foundation.jpeg)  |
 |    Nov 2025   | Foundation and Empire | Isaac Asimov| It’s interesting that this was a trilogy for ages and then the author wrote the following books way, way later. I found I had to keep flipping back to check which character was which. Really good. |  [![book cover](https://github.com/thequietlife/reading/blob/17ce226c4560c46a4fa3c5c7dde20497cd11f8d2/images/Foundation%20and%20Empire.jpeg)](https://github.com/thequietlife/reading/blob/17ce226c4560c46a4fa3c5c7dde20497cd11f8d2/images/Foundation%20and%20Empire.jpeg)  | |
 |    Oct 2025   | Foundation    | Isaac Asimov   | Bit of a difficult read. It felt disjointed but I just found out it was 3 or 4 short stories stitched together. Looking forward to starting the next one which I picked up at a secondhand bookshop.| [![book cover](https://github.com/thequietlife/reading/blob/ed8d54bbc09318d4c7a3ec6f70340dd6d42f0a77/images/foundation.jpeg)](https://github.com/thequietlife/reading/blob/ed8d54bbc09318d4c7a3ec6f70340dd6d42f0a77/images/foundation.jpeg)  |
 |  Dec 2025  | Earth Is Room Enough   | Isaac Asimov | This is the first Isaac Asimov that I have read. It's short stories. I don't love short stories because I usually want the length of a decent size book to get into the characters and story. These are really good. I went on to read another three books by the author (the foundation trilogy) |  [![book cover](https://github.com/thequietlife/reading/blob/1f4e757e1f92a9177105847d3424298cd329a7c7/images/earth%20is%20room%20enough.jpeg)](https://github.com/thequietlife/reading/blob/1f4e757e1f92a9177105847d3424298cd329a7c7/images/earth%20is%20room%20enough.jpeg)  |
