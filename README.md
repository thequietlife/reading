 |  Dec 2025  | Earth Is Room Enough   | Isaac Asimov | This is the first Isaac Asimov that I have read. It's short stories. I don't love short stories because I usually want the length of a decent size book to get into the characters and story. These are really good. I went on to read another three books by the author (the foundation trilogy) |  [![book cover](https://github.com/thequietlife/reading/blob/1f4e757e1f92a9177105847d3424298cd329a7c7/images/earth%20is%20room%20enough.jpeg)](https://github.com/thequietlife/reading/blob/1f4e757e1f92a9177105847d3424298cd329a7c7/images/earth%20is%20room%20enough.jpeg)  |
